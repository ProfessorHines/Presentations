# Development of Environmental Regimes: Hazardous Waste

--

## Summar

>Hazardous waste is discarded materials that pose a threat to human health and the natural environment. Since the exact amount and kind of hazardous waste that constitutes a toxic threat to the global environment is debated, a variety of different regimes have developed to address this issue. The purpose of this lecture is to review how regimes mature using the different hazardous waste regimes as case studies.

## Learning Objectives

* Outline the development chronology of the hazardous waste and toxic chemicals regimes. 

* Use the five stages of regime formation to explain the hazardous waste regime.

* Use the five stages of regime formation to explain the toxic chemicals regime.

* Identify the key lessons learned from the case studies of hazardous waste and toxic chemicals.

* Compare and contrast the outcomes of the hazardous waste and toxic chemicals regimes.

## International regulation of *hazardous waste*

* Developed due to cases of "toxic dumping"
* UNEP developed soft law guidelines that required prior consent and notification, and forbid dumping.
* Eventually, a lead coalition of African states pushed for these rules to be codified into a treaty: The Basel Convention.
* Most effective trade bans are the result of regional agreements outside the Basel Convention.

## International Regulation of *Toxic Chemicals* 

* First regulated in context of warefare in the Hague Conventions, but in modern sense only since 1990s.
* UNEP established a code of conduct requiring prior informed consent (PIC) in the chemical trade. Codified in the Rotterdam Convention (1998).
* Focus shifted from PIC to banning the “dirty dozen” of persistent organic pollutants that bioaccumulate and migrate across boundaries (Stockholm Convention)
* Regime features trade off between veto and supporting states: lots of exceptions for certain uses but mechanism for adding new chemicals.
