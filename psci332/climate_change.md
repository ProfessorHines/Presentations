# Climate Change Regime

---

## Summary

>A regime analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations on the global climate change regime concludes that regime is “underdeveloped and inadequate system.” Here’s why:

## Problems at the 30,000 foot level

1. To avoid the worst consequences large cuts in GHG emissions are required, but humans produce a lot of GHGs for power, heat, industry, and transportation.

2. The most effective ways to reduce emissions are to switch from fossil-fuel-based energy to alternative sources and achieve greater energy efficiency .

3. Any measure adopted to achieve these goals will impose significant economic costs and they will still fall short and thus require additional funds spent on adaptation.

## Distribution of emissions and the consequence

1. Nearly three-quarters of global emissions are the result of seven actors: China, the United States, the European Union, India, the Russian Federation, Japan, and Canada.

2. Any international agreement that fails to include the cooperation of these seven actors will fail to address the problem due to defection and distribution problems.

3. Since the consequences are not just limited to these seven actors,all states will suffer must be a part of the solution (i.e., common but differentiated responsibility).

## Insufficient promotion, assistance, monitoring, and enforcement

2. The UNFCC only establishes the regime’s purpose and establishes a secretariat and set of regular conference.

2. The Kyoto Protocol firmly established the principle of "common but differentiated responsibility" (Annex I and II)

3.The Copenhagen Accord reaffirmed the goal and the idea that indecision at the conference should not be used for inaction.

4. The Durban Platform was a voluntary agreement to keep Kyoto protocol in place until replaced, which anchored discussion.

7. The Durban platform also called for all states to reduce emissions for the first time.

8. To overcome veto states of United States, China, and India, a tactical shift was made to ask states to provide an "Intended Nationally Determined Contribution."

9. Paris Agreement is based on INDCs and voluntaru compliance to acheive. Also shifts basline to 1.5 degrees.

## Unresolved issues

1. No enforcement mechanism

2. Lack of capacity.

3. Funding is inadequte
