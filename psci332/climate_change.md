# Climate Change Regime

---

## Summary

>A regime analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations on the global climate change regime concludes that regime is “underdeveloped and inadequate system.” Here’s why:

---

## Problems at the 30,000 foot level

1. To avoid the worst consequences large cuts in GHG emissions are required, but humans produce a lot of GHGs for power, heat, industry, and transportation.

2. The most effective ways to reduce emissions are to switch from fossil-fuel-based energy to alternative sources and achieve greater energy efficiency .

3. Any measure adopted to achieve these goals will impose significant economic costs and they will still fall short and thus require additional funds spent on adaptation.

---

## Distribution of emissions and the consequence

1. Nearly three-quarters of global emissions are the result of seven actors: China, the United States, the European Union, India, the Russian Federation, Japan, and Canada.

2. Any international agreement that fails to include the cooperation of these seven actors will fail to address the problem due to defection and distribution problems.

3. Since the consequences are not just limited to these seven actors,all states will suffer must be a part of the solution (i.e., common but differentiated responsibility).

## Insufficient promotion, assistance, monitoring, and enforcement

2. The UNFCC only establishes the regime’s purpose and establishes a secretariat and set of regular conference.

> “stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system". 

2. The Kyoto Protocol firmly established the principle of "common but differentiated responsibility" (Annex I and II)

3.The Copenhagen Accord reaffirmed the goal and the idea that indecision at the conference should not be used for inaction.

4. The Durban Platform was a voluntary agreement to keep Kyoto protocol in place until replaced, which anchored discussion.

7. The Durban platform also called for all states to reduce emissions for the first time.

8. To overcome veto states of United States, China, and India, a tactical shift was made to ask states to provide an "Intended Nationally Determined Contribution."

9. Paris Agreement is based on INDCs and voluntaru compliance to acheive. Also shifts basline to 1.5 degrees.

## Unresolved issues

1. No enforcement mechanism
2. Lack of capacity.
3. Funding is inadequte.

---

As a result of these problems, many other international actors have begun to look for alternative institutions and funding mechanisms for addressing climate change.
Some see this as a positive sign of the flexibility of global governance, while others see this as a dangerous development that minimizes the urgency of global action.
While closer to resolution than before, there continues to be tension over how to interpret the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities."
Ultimately, CFR's regime analysis found several strengths and weakness in the regime stemming from these issues.
Although not without controversy, the regime is its strongest at providing information about the threat of climate change thanks to the efforts of the IPCC.
The disconnect between commitments & action, exacerbated by politics and capacity, continue to make longterm effective action on climate change uncertain.
The Clean Development Mechanism, UNREDD, and market efforts like the EU's cap and trade system are working, but remain ineffective and inefficient.
Monitoring and enforcing emissions curbs remains troubling as only developed states report emissions annually and the enforcement mechanism in Kyoto is meaningless.
The Green Climate Fund is inadequate and the regime needs to develop concrete alternatives that states can reliably use to address the $5 trillion price tag of mitigation.
While there has been some success addressing deforestation, the regime currently does not adequately address using natural carbon sinks.
No one has really bought into the ideas that ecological modernization or sustainable development could produce a low-carbon economy because there is no model.
Most serious, in my opinion, is the failure of the regime to address its own recognition that we can no longer just mitigate the affects of climate change and we must adapt.
Given these challenges, Stewart M. Patrick, director of CFR's program on international institutions and global governance provided some potential solutions to these issues.
The CDM could be reformed so that is focuses only on development that would not have happened anyway ("additionally") and the least developed states.
He also advised the U.S. had to take some action through regulatory action to allow a 2020 agreement to be reached, which has actually begun to happen.
The climate change regime needs to build a credible institution or institutions for measuring, reporting, and verifying global emissions and emissions-cutting efforts.
The major international financial institutions (aka Bretton Woods) need to be reformed to focus on and develop expertise in low-carbon development.
International development needs to move from a focus on carbon offsets for developed states to a focus on low-carbon development in developing states.
Climate change should be added to the agenda of other international forums like the Security Council and most importantly, the G-20, which is the main economic forum.
