# Outcomes in Central Europe and the Western Balkans

---

## Summary

> The Czech Republic, Hungry, and Poland are often held up as the most successful post-communist countries due to their peaceful regime changes, track record of free and fair elections, effective economic and political reforms, the establishment of new institutions, and apparent democratic consolidation. In contrast, Yugoslavia entered the postcommunist era in an economic free fall and Yugoslaviaâ€™s six Republics began a painful and protracted splintering into independent states.
