# Outcomes in Central Europe and the Western Balkans

---

## Summary
> The Czech Republic, Hungry, and Poland are often held up as the most successful post-communist countries due to their peaceful regime changes, track record of free and fair elections, effective economic and political reforms, the establishment of new institutions, and apparent democratic consolidation. By orienting themselves quickly to the West economically and in foreign policy, these states “rejoined” Europe more completely than their neighbors with NATO membership in 1999 and membership in the European Union 2004. Despite these successes, all three states have suffered turbulence and uncertainty. In contrast, Yugoslavia entered the postcommunist era in an economic free fall and its central bank was effectively under the control of the IMF.  For decades, Yugoslavia had been one of the wealthiest communist nations but the seemingly rapid democratization and marketization of other Eastern bloc countries threatened this position.  Starting in 1991, Yugoslavia’s six Republics began to splinter into independent states. The breakup of Yugoslavia was both painful and protracted and resulted in a wide variety of outcomes from EU membership to an international occupation.
