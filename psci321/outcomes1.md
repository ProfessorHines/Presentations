# Outcomes in Central Europe and the Western Balkans

---

## Summary

> The Czech Republic, Hungry, and Poland are often held up as the most successful post-communist countries due to their peaceful regime changes, track record of free and fair elections, effective economic and political reforms, the establishment of new institutions, and apparent democratic consolidation. In contrast, Yugoslavia entered the postcommunist era in an economic free fall and Yugoslavia’s six Republics began a painful and protracted splintering into independent states.

## Poland

- Poland was the first country to engage in a transition from communism to a postcommunist state, but the transition was not smooth largely because “shock therapy” economic reform. 
- The first noncommunist government in Poland liberalized prices and currency exchange within months, leading to a significant decline in living standards. 
- Although successful, Poland underwent less radical reforms of its political system because it was the earliest to attempt such reforms and it overestimated the Soviet’s reaction. 
- The general irony of the Polish transition is that Poland had undertaken the most radical economic reforms and had the most-developed civil society, but its transition was troubled.

## Czechoslovakia

- While the Czech and Slovak Republics ended up in the same place after the “Velvet Revolution,” they took different paths to get there and had a “Velvet Divorce” along the way. 
- Economically, both countries have performed well and have a living standard that is higher than during the communist era. They recovered quickly from the 2009 crisis.
- Neither state has yet to develop a stable party system, with new parties competing in each election and a frequent rejection of incumbents over dissatisfaction.

## Hungary

- Hungry’s gradual transition out of communism started well before 1989 and it is therefore consider the smoothest transition amongst post communist states. 
- The smoothness of the transition was a result of economic and political reforms that were instituted following the 1956 Hungarian uprising. 
- The smoothness of the transition had significant consequences for Hungary, the least of which was the return of the communists to power in 1994 (the earliest this happened).
- The biggest challenge for Hungary is its sudden shift towards right-wing politics driven by a rising sense of nationalism and euro-skepticism

## Western Balkans

--The Western Balkans is a term invented by the European Union to cover the states, mostly from the former Yugoslavia, that were
deemed too unstable and undemocratic for membership. Politics in the region has been driven by ongoing external interventions.

## Western Balkans != Central Europe: Three Hypothesis

1. Prior to World War I, the Western Balkans (with the exception of Croatia) were largely been under control of the Ottoman
Turks leading to the idea that the political culture of the area is different than Central Europe.

2. The Western Balkans are some of the most ethnically and nationally diverse states in Europe, leading to problems with the
definition and legitimacy of the state in several Western Balkan states.

3. The violent and slow breakup of Yugoslavia may have left a permeant scar on the political institutions of the region
