## Structure vs. Function: Do regimes collapse because of structural problems or because of functional deficiences?

---

## Structure

1. The structuralist argument is that regimes collapse because they are not constructed properly. 

--

2. Regimes are like a software program that needs to be programmed to include ways to deal with failure modes.

--

3. If the software cannot handle an error, it shuts down (i.e., the regime changes).

## American Revolution: Failure of Structure

1. "No Taxation without Representation": Britain taxed colonists without providing a say in the decision-making.

2. Intolerable Acts and the Quebec Act: Parliament centralized control, leading to open rebellion.

---

## Function

1. The functionalist argument is that regimes collapse because they do not perform properly. 
--

2. In practice, this means that a regime fails to provide public goods or make effective decisions.

---

## American Revolution: Failure of Function

1. A Parliament Divided: Tories and Whigs divided over how to govern colonies, leading to radical and changes and ineffective policies.

2. Most colonists had no strong loyalties to either Crown or Congress, but as Crown proved unable to stop revolutionaries more people became "patriots."

## Small-Group Exercise

> Examine the cases of regime change in Central and Eastern Europe between 1989-1992.

1. Find at least five pieces of evidence each that support structural and functional causes for regime change?

--

2. Write an outline for a five paragraph essay that argues in favor of either the structural or
functional theory of regime change. No equivocating :)
