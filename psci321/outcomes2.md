---

## Summary 

>Due to its size and geopolitical importance, the postcommunist transition in Russia is one of the most studied. Due to its failure to live up to any of the 1990s-era aspirations of the West, its transition is also the source of the biggest frustrations amongst reformers and scholars. Eastern Europe, which initally followed Russia's path, has become one of the most diverse postcommunist regions.
