# RE-CREATING THE MARKET

---

class: middle

## Summary

>Transforming the economies of postcommunist states was the most complicated aspect of the transition. There was no single model for how to make the changes because a market economy had never been built from scratch before. This meant most reforms happened haphazardly, with the understanding of what worked and what didn’t only being developed afterwards. Long-term success seemed to be determined by the economic conditions of the communist economy and the strength of commitment by successive governments. Complicating the transition were governments committed to reforms that outsiders saw as successful, but the domestic population saw as failures.
