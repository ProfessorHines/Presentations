# Institutional Context: Bureaucracy 
 
---

## Summary

> Since we do not have an imaginary ideal policy-making machine to conduct our foreign policy, we need a bureaucracy to implement the decisions of the President and Congress. The main foreign policy bureaucracies are the State Department, Department of Defense, and the intelligence community lead by the Central Intelligence Agency. The organizational behavior model and the government politics model of foreign policy decision-making focus on how the organization, values, and attitudes of those who work for and head these agencies leads to different choices about the ends and means of foreign policy.
