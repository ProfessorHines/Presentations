## Summary

>Although ideational and historical contexts matter a great deal in the policy making process, ultimately institutional procedures determine how decisions are made and implemented. The Constitution separates the foreign policy powers of the United States between Congress and the President in an effort to check and balance their influence. Although the Constitution in theory balances the war powers of Congress and President, in practice there is an imbalance that gives power to the President at the expense of Congress because Congress is slow to use its foreign policy powers.
