# Big Wars, Small Wars

---

## Summary

> One of the defining characteristics of a great power is their capacity to wage big wars with conventional (and nonconventional) forces against other great powers. This requires great powers to invest significantly in their militaries and to develop the ability to engage in symmetrical warfare with their rivals. The United States is no exception to this rule. It has developed the most powerful military ever assembled, with U.S. defense spending larger than all other great powers combined. This has a profound impact on American foreign policy.

## Analyze the practicality of using nuclear weapons in place of conventional weapons.

1. How can nuclear and conventional weapons be used for deterrence and for preemption?
2. Are nuclear weapons ever a practical tool (e.g., nuclear bunker busters on pg. 309-31)?

## Evaluate alternative models of conventional war fighting capabilities (Small Group).

1. How many wars should the U.S. be able to fight simultaneously? Why?
2. Is there a difference to planning on fighting more than one war and the 1-4-2-1 plan from 2006?
3. What conventional war fighting capabilities should the U.S. commit to in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review?

> Report your plan to the class. Is it better than the actual standard developed in the 2014 QDR?

## 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review

> "Protect the homeland, to deter and defeat attacks on the United States and to support civil authorities in mitigating the effects of potential attacks and natural disasters.

> Build security globally, in order to preserve regional stability, deter adversaries, support allies and partners, and cooperate with others to address common security challenges.

> Project power and win decisively, to defeat aggression, disrupt and destroy terrorist
networks, and provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief."

## 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review

> "If deterrence fails at any given time, U.S. forces will be capable of defeating a regional adversary in a large-scale multi-phased campaign, and denying the objectives of – or imposing unacceptable costs on – a second aggressor in another region."
